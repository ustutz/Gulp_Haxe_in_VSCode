# Gulp Haxe in VSCode

## Automatic Haxe sourcecode compilation and browser update without previous Haxe installation

## Requirements

· npm is installed  
· gulp is installed globally  
· Visual Studio Code is installed with Haxe Support Plugin

### Instructions to use:  
· Clone repository  
· Open terminal window and go to 'Gulp_Haxe_in_VSCode' folder  
· Type 'npm install'  
· Wait for gulp and gulp-haxe to be installed (contains Haxe 3.2.1 for now)  
· Type 'gulp serve'
· The page opens in the browser  
· Open Visual Studio Code and set folder to 'Gulp_Haxe_in_VSCode'  
· Change Main.hx. You should get an error message "Unsupported Haxe version! Minimum version required: 3.4.0". But some code completion features should work with the old Haxe version.  
· Watch the automatic compilation to main.js  
· Watch the automatic browser update  
· Smile :-)
